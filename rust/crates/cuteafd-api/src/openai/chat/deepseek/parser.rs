//! DeepSeek V4/V4.1 output parser: the DSML tool-call grammar, emitted as
//! protocol-neutral [`OutputChunk`]s through the same [`TextParser`] contract
//! GLM and Qwen use ([`GlmStreamProcessor`]).
//!
//! ```text
//! <｜DSML｜ calls>
//! <｜DSML｜ invoke name="search">
//! <｜DSML｜ parameter name="query" string="true">cats</｜DSML｜ parameter>
//! </｜DSML｜ invoke>
//! </｜DSML｜ calls>
//! ```
//!
//! The grammar itself is `deepseek_recipe`'s own incremental state machine
//! (`state_machine::{StateMachine, OutputAction}`), reused here rather than
//! re-implemented: [`DeepseekOutputParser`] drives it and translates its
//! actions to [`OutputChunk`]s exactly as `deepseek_recipe::stream::processor`
//! does, so a well-formed response parses identically.
//!
//! FR-G.14 (hold a call until it closes; return an unreadable one as content;
//! `finish_reason: tool_calls` only for a call that parsed; log each lost
//! call) is the one intended difference — the crate's processor drops a
//! malformed call and claims a tool call as soon as the name completes:
//!
//! - a call is **held** from `<｜DSML｜ invoke name="` until its closing
//!   `</｜DSML｜ invoke>`; a client never sees part of a call that turns out
//!   malformed (the SSE keepalive covers the wait);
//! - a call that never closes (truncated by `max_tokens`, or its name is empty
//!   or carries markup) is returned as content from its `<｜DSML｜` marker and
//!   logged, and does not count as a tool call;
//! - a call that *does* close is still lost when the machine skipped material
//!   inside it that is not part of the DSML skeleton (a malformed parameter
//!   envelope, an empty or unquoted parameter name), or when the arguments it
//!   assembled are not valid JSON. The first of those is invisible to a JSON
//!   check alone: the machine skips the unreadable bytes and goes on to emit a
//!   perfectly valid `{}`, so the call would otherwise be accepted with the
//!   argument silently missing. The skipped run is validated against the
//!   grammar's own delimiters ([`skip_is_structural`]), never per segment,
//!   because the machine splits a run wherever a partial match fails.
//!
//! The hold-and-return-as-content contract is adopted from glm53f-api's
//! `dialect/glm.rs` (Hugh Madden, MIT), which FR-G.14 applies to every
//! dialect. No donor source is reproduced: the code here is written against
//! `deepseek_recipe`'s own state machine, and the crate's processor is the
//! differential reference in the tests below.
